= Installing and configuring Eclipse for BNU`Bot 2.0 ===
== Get Java ==
If you don't already have the JRE (1.5 or later), get it from Sun's website.
== Getting started with Eclipse ==
=== Download Eclipse ===
Visit [http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/] and click:
[http://www.eclipse.org/home/images/downloadbutton.gif]
The package "Eclipse IDE for Java Developers" is sufficient.
=== Install Eclipse ===
 * Windows: Unzip the file you just downloaded to your Program Files directory, or anywhere that you want to keep it.
 * OSX: Drag the Eclipse application to your Applications folder.
 * Linux: Installation varies from distribution to distribution; seek instructions from your distribution's website, or from the Eclipse.org website.
=== Launch Eclipse ===
Launch Eclipse. It will take a few moments to load. It will ask you for a directory to store your workspace. This is where all of the BNU-Bot and JBLS source code, compiled bytecode, libraries, and settings files will reside. I strongly recommend using the default path. When Eclipse is done loading, close the welcome window.

 * Click on the *Help* menu, and navigate to *Software Updates*, and then *Find and Install...*.
 * Select *Search for new features to install*, and click *Next*.

 * For *Name*, enter "Subclipse"
 * For *URL*, enter "http://subclipse.tigris.org/update_1.2.x"
 * Click *OK*, and make sure the box next to "Subclipse" is checked.
 * Click *Finish*.
=== Installing the Subclipse plugin ===
